I wanted a website, to post stuff of potential interest to others and to experiment. Goals:
* simple
* flexible
* allow multiple technologies
* something I can grow

Landed on:
* [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) - Static blog that sounded cool.
* [DigitalOcean](https:/digitalocean.com) - Development environment and maybe for running experiments.
* [Netifly](https://netifly.com) - Static site web host.

Capitalize on low hanging fruit to identify a ballpark value added activity to beta test. Override the digital divide with additional clickthroughs from DevOps. Nanotechnology immersion along the information highway will close the loop on focusing solely on the bottom line.

}

// Test with a line break above this line.
console.log('Test');
