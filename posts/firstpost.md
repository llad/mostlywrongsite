Wanted a website to publish stuff and to experiment.

Goals:
* Simple
* Flexible
* Support multiple technologies
* Something I can grow

Landed on:
* [DigitalOcean](https:/digitalocean.com) - Development environment and maybe for running experiments.
* [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) - Static site generator that sounded cool.
* [Netifly](https://netifly.com) - Static site web host.

## Initial Setup
* Node.js instance
* install Eleventy


* Save github password:
``` text/2-3
git config --global credential.helper cache
```
