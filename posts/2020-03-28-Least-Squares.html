<p>Below is an Observable notebook I created to explore Least Squares Regression. It is probably best consumed over at Observable but it is possible to embed notebooks in a site so I wanted to try that too.</p>

<a href="https://observablehq.com/@llad/least-squares-exploration">View this notebook on Observable</a>
</p>

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/inspector@3/dist/inspector.css">

<div id="notebook"></div>

<script type="module">

// Load the Observable runtime and inspector.
import {Runtime, Inspector} from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@4/dist/runtime.js";

// Your notebook, compiled as an ES module.
//import notebook from "https://api.observablehq.com/@jashkenas/my-neat-notebook.js?v=3";
import notebook from "https://api.observablehq.com/@llad/least-squares-exploration.js?v=3";

// Load the notebook, observing its cells with a default Inspector
// that simply renders the value of each cell into the provided DOM node.
new Runtime().module(notebook, Inspector.into(document.querySelector("#notebook")));
